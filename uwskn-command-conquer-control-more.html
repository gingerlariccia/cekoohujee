I'm looking for some personal opinions here. So we all know that one of the most requested features of Kenshi is the ability to actually effect the state of the world. Specifically, people want to be able to change the world for the better.

The real-time part is pretty self-explanatory: every entity runs their time with you. The problem is strategy. What is strategy? Strategy. Let's talk a little bit about Hordak. And what we’ve learned from Season 2. Don’t read on if you don’t want to see spoilers from both Season 1 and 2. Hordak for all intense and purposes is the big bad guy of She-ra. However, we currently have never seen him in action. How strong is he? If he fought She-ra; would he completely out class her and defeat her without any problems?

I am less concerned with WHEN it fits and more concerned with HOW it fits. Curse of Strahd doesn't match up with the original lore, ignoring and changing the history previously established.
