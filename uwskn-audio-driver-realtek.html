My problem is : I've got no sound from my speakers (plugged on the back panel), while headphones work (plugged on the front panel). I reinstalled the audio drivers (Realtek Audio ALC 1220), downloaded from Gigabyte's site, and of course tried plugging my speakers on different slots. It didn't solve the issue. The odd thing really is that headphones work, so sound. Realtek AC97 Driver - универсальный драйвер. Realtek AC97.

I basically get the “The audio service is not running” error once a day now and the only way I can fix it is by uninstalling and reinstalling my audio drivers (Realtek HDA). In the services app it says Windows Audio and all its dependencies are running but they don’t respond when trying to stop/restart them and they obviously don’t work. The worst thing is that I can’t even start any programs that output sound. Does anyone know how to fix this error permanently?

Update: Fixed the issue (for now) by disconnecting and reconnecting this cable (https://i.imgur.com/RCGF1HE.jpg), which was right below the area in question. I also reconnected the other side of this cable (I/O) and relocated the 1 missing screw on my laptop to better support this area, which may have had an effect. I appreciate the help guys.

So I'm having this weird audio issue where the sounds are quieter directly in front of me or behind me. The left and right speakers are quite loud but in front or behind me is just too quiet. For example. If I backstab an enemy, the backstab sound is really quiet, it's almost silent. But if I spin the camera right as I get it, its super loud on a certain speaker. Or if someone is speaking and they are directly in front of me then its super quiet unless i swivel the camera Hi, I'm a noob to Reaper and I've just installed it on Windows 10. For the audio device setup, I've chosen audio system: ASIO and audio driver: Realtek ASIO. Now, I'm constantly getting a popup saying "Error: Different ASIO sample types per stream, not compatible". I guess I can't be the first person to have this problem, as I'm using a pretty common PC build, but Google hasn't found any previous references to this error. Can anyone suggest something I just got this game since it's free on Bethesda's site, when i opened it the furst time it worked fine but i decided i'll install 2 mods: the other one to patch some bugs and the other one to make the graphics a bit better and now it gives me the error stated in the title There are no updates for my audio driver (Realtek) and i tried changing the default player, any help is appreciated. 
After the patch in early April (I can't remember which one it was exactly) I have experienced constant crashing. Sometimes I could play for up to 10 minutes, but most of the time I would crash within a minute or two entering gameplay, sometimes within seconds. amp#x200B; My PC specs: • 3570K @ 4.4 GHZ • GTX 1070 - stock to slightly overclocked settings • 16gb ram • Windows 10 Playing at 1080p on high to ultra settings amp#x200B; I tried everything I read in the Ubisoft forums. I've been having several audio over the past few weeks, with input and output audio failing to work. Issues I've had: Initially, I noticed my microphone kept cutting out for a few seconds at a time while on Discord. I've been using iPhone earphones I was given with a headset splitter that came with my most recent headset (that I stopped using as it was way too uncomfortable). Unplugging the earphones and splitter made little difference, my mic would cut in and out at random. i'm not the smartest person and i build my first computer following a guide on YouTube, the pc has been running and being able to play games and function for the last 6 months, but everytime i have a few issues i'm getting paranoid if i messed something up while building it, wrong cable or whatever. is it safe to say i build the pc correctly? or is it possible i fucked up some things? i've been using a headset with usb for a while and it worked perfectly but i've recently bought Hello guys, im sorry if this is the wrong subreddit but here we go. amp#x200B; Today i was doing stuff on my pc when suddenly my right earbox stopped working. Unplugging helped at first but then it stopped working again. I went to test the headset on a Samsung galaxy (obv 3.5 jack) It didnt have sound on the right earphone either so i gave it a last try on another device, my laptop. Its an hp pavillon with three 3.5 jacks on the left side. One is for the microphone i guess. So i plugged. Hi So I've bought the logitech g533 which has a wireless USB dongle. I connected it and everything works but the mic only picks up my voice if I push the mic against my mouth. Things I've tried: Installing/ reinstalling all audio drivers (realtek,Asus,logitech) Boosting mic levels too 100, Updating firmware, USB dongle in USB 2.0 and 3.0, Tried APO equalizer , Reinstalling windows , Tried on a laptop which has the same issue, Trouble shooting doesnt find any problems. I'm out of ideas Hey, hi, hello Since June I have a new PC and after acquiring new, louder headphones (Hyperx Cloud Silvers) I began hearing weird electrical/static noise in them. The noise becomes louder, the louder system volume is. It sounds like this, and appears on video+audio capture and stream capture (sorry for streamable link): https://streamable.com/6hzt4 It's not headphones/ speakers fault, when I use them with my phone/other device they work flawlessly fine. The thing is, the noise appears Hello. I upgraded to windows 10 yesterday from windows 7. After doing this, my headphones no longer seemed to work; my sound worked without them plugged in, but with them plugged in, no sound from either the laptop speakers or the headphones. Investigating a little, I found in the control panel that the headphones were being recognized as an external microphone. My headphones don't have a microphone on them, and even when I plugged in just a 3.5mm audio cable to the jack, it was still recognized. First, I have tried almost every suggestion I've seen online, but it's difficult to say if something was missed or messed up. With that said I'm happy to provide all the information I can to help you help me, how very frustrating it is to spend an entire day fixing an issue which didn't exist when i turned the computer off last night. First, please clear up my confusion about this. This (https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/GA-Z97X-Gaming-5-rev-10#support-dl-driver) is my motherboards driver. I am relatively new at this, but this is surely the wrong chipset driver that Gigabyte is telling me to download on their page for AB350. (https://www.gigabyte.com/in/Motherboard/GA-AB350-Gaming-3-rev-1x#support-dl-driver-chipset) They are giving b450 chipset drivers. Also, I don't know what DCH is but clearly selecting normal Win 10 x64 prompts user to download DCH audio driver (Realtek Audio Driver (Note) Win10 ver.1709 \\\\ver.1803 supported.Version\ 8475\. 
My PC randomly reboots while playing games. It doesn't overheat, as I have had core temp on and it doesn't show super high temperatures. It started just after I reinstalled my audio drivers (Realtek audio drivers, they specify it to be windows 10 but on the installer, it says windows vista/xp/7/8/8.1 or something. If anyone has the proper installation software link then I'd like to have it) and updated my drivers (2 updates). I tried uninstalling the new drivers but it just kept happening I'm struggling with annoying bug. I don't have sound in game at all. It drives me crazy, because I paid for the game and cannot enjoy it in 100%. Tried to reinstall audio drivers (Realtek ALC892), Disabling All Enchantments, changing frequencies - still nothing. The problem is both on Speakers, as well on Headphones (connected to front sound output). When I reinstalled realtek drivers for the first time it worked, but afterwards this bug came again. I'm getting really mad because Is there a way to keep all of my drivers automatically updated? Or does windows take care of this? Realtek audio drivers, Realtek HDaudio drivers, LAN drivers, Wireless LAN and Bluetooth drivers, Chipset drivers, Nvidia drivers, my BIOS. Basically looking to keep everything up to date. Like I said, does Windows automatically take care of this? I just updated my chipset driver manually and it was out of date, could have sworn that Windows takes care of AMD updates. My motherboard is a Gigabyte. 
Hello guys Today i was doing stuff on my pc when suddenly my right earbox stopped working. I went to test the headset on a Samsung galaxy (obv 3.5 jack) It didnt have sound on the right earphone either so i gave it a last try on another device, my laptop.

So i plugged it into one jack and it still wasnt working, then i put it in the 2nd 3.5mm jack and voila, sound on both earphones. I immediately plugge.
